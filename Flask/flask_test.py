This program currently works on Taobao.com only.
On clicking the box under thumbnail photo, a popup window should be displayed containing
the photo with all of its human face swapped.
If there is no face in the photo (or no detectable face), original photo should be displayed
The popup window will close on clicking the image itself

You will need: (in windows environment)
The code itself of course
python(3)
openCV and Dlib for face processing
Cmake for Dlib
Visual studio for Cmake (Do not untick the boxes when installing unless u know what u r doing)
numpy
flask
Install provided userscript (script.user.js) to ur browser (with Chrome: tampermonkey or Firefox: greasemonkey)
I'm using tampermonkey, just paste the content and save works for me.
Should work on firefox but never tried

To run the code: simply type >python flask_test.py in terminal
To use another face: put another jpg photo containing one face into the face folder and restart the program

How it works:
Pretty simple, face image is processed on startup.
Get url with the userscript and POST it to local server. Download the image.
Swap the faces, GET the popup page that displays the image. Popup with the userscript.
